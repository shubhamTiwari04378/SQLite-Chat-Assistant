# SQLite-Chat-Assistant

# Objective
The objective of this project is to create an intelligent system that can understand user queries in plain language, convert them into SQL commands, and fetch relevant information from a structured database.

# Features
Key Features
- Efficiently handles queries about employees and departments stored in an SQLite database.
- Provides meaningful responses even for invalid or unclear queries.

# Core Components
- Natural Language Processing (NLP):
- Utilizes NLTK to tokenize and parse user queries for identifying key components such as department names, dates, and query intent.
- Database Integration: The system is backed by an SQLite database containing information about employees and departments. SQL queries are dynamically generated based on user input.
- User Interface (UI):Built with Streamlit for a clean and interactive interface where users can input queries and view results instantly.

# How It Works
- The user inputs a query in plain language, such as "Who is the manager of Sales?"
- The system processes the query using NLP techniques to extract relevant keywords and intent.
- The extracted information is converted into an SQL query.
- The query is executed on the SQLite database, and the results are displayed to the user.

# Advantages
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Efficient data retrieval from a structured database.
- Capable of understanding natural language queries.
- Potential Enhancements
- Support for more complex query types.
- Advanced NLP capabilities with modern language models.
- Improved error handling and query interpretation.
- Expansion to larger databases and user authentication.
